# Gosling-s-Student-Academic-Performance-Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student performance dataset to understand the factors that may influence academic outcomes.

Rather than jumping directly into predictive modeling, the primary objective of this project is to deeply explore the data, uncover patterns, and generate meaningful insights through visualization and statistical exploration.

🎯 Objectives

Inspect and understand dataset structure

Identify missing values and data quality issues

Analyze score distributions across subjects

Compare performance across different student groups

Explore relationships between academic subjects

Extract meaningful insights using data visualization

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains student-related attributes such as:
first_name
last_name
email
gender
part_time_job
absence_days
extracurricular_activities
weekly_self_study_hours
career_aspiration
science subjects score 
These variables allow for comparative and relationship-based analysis of student performance.

🔎 Exploratory Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Data Inspection & Cleaning

Checked data types

Verified missing values

Ensured data consistency

2️⃣ Score Distribution Analysis

Visualized distributions of math, reading, and writing scores

Identified spread, central tendency, and variation

3️⃣ Group-Based Performance Comparison

Compared academic performance across:
gender 
extracurricular_activities
weekly_self_study_hours
career_aspiration
science subjects scores
4️⃣ Correlation & Relationship Analysis

Analyzed relationships between subject scores

Explored correlation patterns using heatmaps and visualizations

📊 Key Insights

Subject scores show strong relationships with one another.

Group-based comparisons reveal noticeable differences in performance trends.

Visual exploration highlights patterns that are not immediately obvious from raw numerical data.

This reinforces the importance of EDA as a foundational step before applying machine learning techniques.
